  <em>Transform intentions into actions, actions into habits, habits into mastery.</em>

## Vision

Praxis Forge is a sophisticated task and habit management system that embodies the philosophical concept of "praxis" - the process of putting theoretical knowledge into practice. Built with Rust, Elixir, and modern web technologies, it transforms how we approach personal development and productivity.

### Core Philosophy

The name "Praxis Forge" combines two powerful concepts:

- **Praxis**: The practice of applying knowledge, emphasizing the transformation of theory into action
- **Forge**: A place of creation and transformation, where raw materials are shaped into refined forms

This synthesis reflects our belief that personal growth occurs through deliberate practice and consistent action.

## Architecture
