# Research Directions: Cross-Language Solutions & Rust/Leptos Limitations

## 1. Advanced Signal Composition Patterns

### Language Example: Haskell with Reflex FRP

**How Haskell/Reflex solves it:**
Reflex provides a comprehensive FRP system with higher-order event combinators, efficient dependency tracking, and principled handling of time-varying values.

```haskell
-- Example of advanced signal composition in Reflex
countUp :: MonadWidget t m => m ()
countUp = do
  tick <- tickLossy 1.0 0
  let count = accumDyn (+) 0 (1 <$ tick)
      doubled = fmap (*2) count
      isEven = fmap even doubled

  -- These update efficiently and compose naturally
  display count
  display doubled
  dynText $ fmap (\e -> if e then "Even" else "Odd") isEven
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos signals lack advanced combinators for complex transformations and have limited support for handling collections of signals or dynamic signal creation/disposal.

```rust
// Current approach in Leptos - more verbose, less composable
let (count, set_count) = create_signal(0);
let doubled = move || count() * 2;
let is_even = move || doubled() % 2 == 0;

// No built-in operators for signal composition
// No first-class handling of signal collections
```

## 2. Zero-Cost DOM Abstractions

### Language Example: Svelte with Compile-time DOM Operations

**How Svelte solves it:**
Svelte compiles declarative templates into highly optimized imperative DOM operations at build time, eliminating the need for runtime reconciliation.

```svelte
<!-- Svelte component -->
<script>
  let count = 0;
  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
  Count: {count}
</button>

<!-- Compiles to efficient JS that directly manipulates the DOM -->
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos still relies on a runtime view system and JavaScript interop for many DOM operations, adding overhead compared to direct DOM manipulation.

```rust
// Current Leptos approach
view! {
    <button on:click=move |_| set_count.update(|c| *c + 1)>
        "Count: " {count}
    </button>
}

// This gets compiled to Rust code that still needs to interact
// with the DOM through JavaScript bindings, adding overhead
```

## 3. Resumability Advancements

### Language Example: Qwik Framework (JavaScript)

**How Qwik solves it:**
Qwik implements true resumability by serializing the execution state of components and listeners, allowing the application to "continue" on the client exactly where the server left off with minimal JS.

```jsx
// Qwik component
export const Counter = component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  // This handler is serialized and only loaded when needed
  const increment = $(() => count.value++);

  return <button onClick$={increment}>Count: {count.value}</button>;
});
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos' resumability still requires sending more client-side JavaScript than theoretically necessary, and has limitations with complex state patterns and closures.

```rust
// Leptos server function
#[server]
async fn increment_count(count: i32) -> Result<i32, ServerFnError> {
    Ok(count + 1)
}

// Client needs to download more code for hydration
// than a truly resumable system would require
```

## 4. WASM Optimization Techniques

### Language Example: AssemblyScript with Optimized Compilation

**How AssemblyScript solves it:**
AssemblyScript is specifically designed for WebAssembly output, with optimizations for code size, startup time, and memory usage built into the language and compiler.

```typescript
// AssemblyScript example
export function fibonacci(n: i32): i32 {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Compiles to highly optimized WASM with minimal overhead
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Rust's rich type system and standard library can lead to large WASM binaries, and the current tooling doesn't provide fine-grained control over WASM-specific optimizations.

```rust
// Rust code can generate larger WASM binaries
// due to monomorphization and standard library inclusion
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 { return n; }
    fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

// The resulting WASM may include unnecessary code
```

## 5. Glitch-Free Propagation Techniques

### Language Example: Elm's Predictable State Management

**How Elm solves it:**
Elm's architecture ensures consistent state updates through a centralized update function and immutable data, preventing "glitches" where the UI reflects inconsistent state.

```elm
-- Elm update function ensures consistent state
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment ->
      ({ model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none)

    -- All derived values are computed in one pass
    -- No possibility of seeing inconsistent state
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos' signal system can potentially have propagation issues in complex dependency graphs where signals update in an order that temporarily creates inconsistent state.

```rust
// Potential for glitches in complex signal graphs
let (a, set_a) = create_signal(0);
let (b, set_b) = create_signal(0);
let sum = move || a() + b();
let is_even = move || sum() % 2 == 0;

// If a and b update in quick succession,
// observers might see intermediate states
```

## 6. Compile-time Reactivity Optimizations

### Language Example: Svelte's Compile-time Reactivity

**How Svelte solves it:**
Svelte analyzes reactive dependencies at compile time and generates code that directly updates only what needs to change, without runtime dependency tracking overhead.

```svelte
<script>
  let a = 1;
  let b = 2;

  // Svelte analyzes this at compile time
  $: sum = a + b;
  $: doubled = sum * 2;
</script>

<!-- Generates optimized code with no runtime reactivity system -->
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos relies on runtime dependency tracking, which adds overhead compared to a compile-time approach, and the macro system has limitations in how much it can optimize.

```rust
// Leptos requires runtime dependency tracking
let (a, set_a) = create_signal(1);
let (b, set_b) = create_signal(2);

// These dependencies are tracked at runtime
let sum = move || a() + b();
let doubled = move || sum() * 2;
```

## 7. Cross-platform Reactive Patterns

### Language Example: Flutter's Unified Widget Model

**How Flutter solves it:**
Flutter provides a consistent reactive programming model across platforms, with the same widget system and state management working identically on mobile, web, and desktop.

```dart
// Flutter's reactive model works across platforms
class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterState createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int count = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () => setState(() => count++),
      child: Text('Count: $count'),
    );
  }
}
```

**Rust/Leptos limitation:**
Leptos is primarily focused on web applications, with limited support for sharing reactive patterns across platforms like mobile or desktop without additional abstractions.

```rust
// Leptos is web-focused
// For desktop apps via Tauri, you need separate code for native functionality
fn Counter() -> impl IntoView {
    let (count, set_count) = create_signal(0);

    view! {
        <button on:click=move |_| set_count.update(|c| *c + 1)>
            "Count: " {count}
        </button>
    }
}

// No built-in way to share this reactive model with native platforms
```
