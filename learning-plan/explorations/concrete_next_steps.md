# Leptos' Direction and Your Role in Advancing Rust on the Frontend

## Leptos' Primary Intentions

Leptos doesn't explicitly position itself as an FRP framework, but rather as a "fine-grained reactive" web framework. Its core intentions appear to be:

1. **Bringing Rust's Safety and Performance to the Frontend**

   - Leveraging Rust's type system and memory safety for UI development
   - Utilizing WebAssembly for high-performance browser applications

2. **Fine-grained Reactivity for Efficiency**

   - Minimizing unnecessary re-renders through granular updates
   - Automatic dependency tracking for developer ergonomics

3. **Isomorphic Rendering with Resumability**

   - Same code running on server and client
   - Innovative "resumable" approach to hydration

4. **Developer Experience Without Compromise**
   - Rust's safety with React-like ergonomics
   - Declarative view syntax with strong typing

Greg Johnston (Leptos creator) has cited SolidJS as a major inspiration, which uses signals but doesn't claim to be pure FRP either. This suggests Leptos is pragmatically adopting reactive patterns that work well for web development rather than adhering strictly to FRP theory.

## The Cutting Edge: Where to Focus

If you want to be at the cutting edge of Rust frontend development with Leptos, here are the most promising directions that align with your deep focus areas:

### 1. Advanced Signal Composition Patterns

**Why it matters**: This pushes the boundaries of what's possible with Leptos' reactivity system while staying aligned with its core design philosophy.

**Potential contributions**:

- Develop higher-order signal operators (similar to RxJS but optimized for Leptos)
- Create patterns for complex state derivation with minimal performance overhead
- Build debugging and visualization tools for signal dependency graphs

**Research direction**: Explore how functional programming concepts from languages like Haskell could be applied to Leptos signals while maintaining Rust's performance characteristics.

### 2. Zero-Cost DOM Abstractions

**Why it matters**: This directly addresses your focus on DOM manipulation in Rust and pushes Leptos toward more efficient rendering.

**Potential contributions**:

- Implement direct DOM manipulation techniques that bypass JS interop where possible
- Create specialized rendering paths for high-performance components
- Develop compile-time optimizations for view templates

**Research direction**: Investigate how much of the DOM API can be exposed directly to Rust without sacrificing performance or developer experience.

### 3. Resumability Advancements

**Why it matters**: This is one of Leptos' most innovative features and represents a genuine advancement in SSR technology.

**Potential contributions**:

- Improve the efficiency of state serialization/deserialization
- Reduce the client-side JavaScript needed for resumption
- Create patterns for partial resumability of complex applications

**Research direction**: Study how resumability could be extended to more complex state patterns and asynchronous operations.

### 4. WASM Optimization Techniques

**Why it matters**: This directly supports your WASM profiling focus and addresses a critical adoption barrier for Rust on the frontend.

**Potential contributions**:

- Develop specialized profiling tools for Leptos applications
- Create optimization patterns for reducing WASM binary size
- Implement efficient memory management patterns for UI components

**Research direction**: Explore how compiler features like monomorphization affect WASM size and how to mitigate these effects.

## Strategic Alignment with Leptos' Direction

Rather than trying to push Leptos toward pure FRP (which may not align with its pragmatic goals), I recommend focusing on advancing its existing strengths while addressing its current limitations:

### Embrace Pragmatic Reactivity

Leptos takes a pragmatic approach to reactivity that borrows from FRP without being dogmatic about it. This approach makes sense for web development where pure FRP can sometimes be overly academic.

Focus on making Leptos' reactivity system more powerful and efficient within its existing paradigm rather than trying to make it conform to pure FRP theory.

### Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap

You can still bring valuable FRP concepts to Leptos where they make practical sense:

- Implement glitch-free propagation techniques from FRP literature
- Explore how topological sorting algorithms can optimize Leptos' dependency tracking
- Investigate how FRP's handling of time could improve animation and async operations

### Pioneer New Territory

The most exciting opportunities may lie in areas where Leptos is already innovating:

1. **Rust-native UI patterns**: Developing idioms that leverage Rust's unique features for UI development
2. **Compile-time reactivity optimizations**: Using Rust's macro system to move work from runtime to compile time
3. **Cross-platform reactivity**: Extending Leptos' model to native applications via Tauri

## Concrete Next Steps

1. **Engage with the Leptos community**

   - Join the Discord and participate in discussions about the framework's direction
   - Study the roadmap and identify areas where your interests align

2. **Conduct comparative analysis**

   - Benchmark Leptos against other reactive frameworks (SolidJS, Svelte, etc.)
   - Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

3. **Build experimental extensions**

   - Create a library of advanced signal operators for Leptos
   - Develop profiling and visualization tools for signal dependencies
   - Implement prototype optimizations for DOM operations

4. **Document and share your findings**
   - Write technical articles about your experiments
   - Present at Rust conferences about frontend development
   - Contribute to Leptos documentation and examples

By focusing on these areas, you'll be working at the cutting edge of Rust frontend development while aligning with Leptos' pragmatic approach to reactivity. This positions you to make meaningful contributions that advance both the framework and the broader goal of bringing Rust to the frontend.
