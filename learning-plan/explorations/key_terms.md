# Key Programming Concepts for Cutting-Edge Development

Here's a comprehensive list of key terms and concepts that represent the cutting edge of programming, particularly in reactive systems and high-performance applications. These concepts are largely language-agnostic but have particular relevance to your Rust work.

## Core Reactive Programming Concepts

1. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**

   - The pure functional approach to building reactive systems
   - Emphasizes time-varying values and functional transformations

2. **Signal-based Reactivity**

   - Fine-grained reactivity model based on individual values that change over time
   - Foundation for modern reactive frameworks like SolidJS and newer Angular

3. **Push vs. Pull-based Reactivity**

   - Different models for propagating changes through a reactive system
   - Trade-offs between efficiency and predictability

4. **Glitch-free Propagation**

   - Ensuring consistent state during reactive updates
   - Preventing temporary inconsistencies during change propagation

5. **Topological Sorting in Dependency Graphs**

   - Algorithm for determining the correct order of updates in reactive systems
   - Critical for maintaining consistency in complex signal networks

6. **Memoization in Reactive Systems**
   - Caching derived values to prevent redundant computation
   - Balancing memory usage with computational efficiency

## Advanced Performance Concepts

7. **Zero-cost Abstractions**

   - Programming patterns that introduce no runtime overhead when not used
   - Core philosophy in Rust and modern C++

8. **Compile-time Evaluation**

   - Moving computation from runtime to compile time

## Advanced Type System Concepts

23. **Dependent Types**

    - Type systems where types can depend on values
    - Emerging area in programming language theory

24. **Linear Types**

    - Type systems that enforce exactly-once usage of resources
    - Related to Rust's ownership but more formal

25. **Effect Systems**

    - Type-level tracking of computational effects
