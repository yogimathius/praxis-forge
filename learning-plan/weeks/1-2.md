# Optimized Starting Point for Your Deep Focus Areas

## Evaluating "Functional Reactive Programming" by Stephen Blackheath

While "Functional Reactive Programming" by Stephen Blackheath is an excellent resource for understanding FRP fundamentals, it may not be the optimal starting point for all your deep focus areas.

### Strengths for Your Focus Areas:

- Provides solid theoretical foundation for signal-based reactivity
- Explains dependency tracking and propagation in depth
- Covers functional composition of reactive values

### Limitations for Your Focus Areas:

- Focuses on traditional FRP rather than fine-grained reactivity systems like Leptos
- Contains minimal content on DOM manipulation or WebAssembly
- Doesn't address resumability or SSR concepts
- Examples are in Java/Scala rather than Rust or JavaScript

## Recommended Starting Approach

Instead of starting with just one resource, I recommend a multi-pronged approach that addresses all your focus areas from the beginning:

### 1. For Signal Pattern Improvements

**Start with:**

- **"A Hands-on Introduction to Fine-Grained Reactivity"** by Ryan Carniato
  - [Article Link](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf)
  - Directly applicable to Leptos' signal system
  - Written by SolidJS creator (major influence on Leptos)

**Then move to:**

- Chapters 1-3 of Blackheath's FRP book for theoretical foundation
- Leptos source code, particularly the `leptos_reactive` module
  - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/leptos_reactive/src)

### 2. For DOM Manipulation in Rust

**Start with:**

- **"WebAssembly for Web Developers"** by Surma and Nolan
  - [Article Link](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/hotpath-with-wasm)
  - Covers performance-critical DOM operations with WASM

**Then explore:**

- Leptos view macro implementation
  - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/blob/main/leptos_macro/src/view.rs)
- web-sys documentation for DOM manipulation
  - [Docs Link](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/)

### 3. For Rust WASM Profiling

**Start with:**

- **"Rust and WebAssembly"** official book, profiling chapter
  - [Book Link](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/profiling.html)
  - Covers fundamental WASM profiling techniques

**Then explore:**

- Twiggy for code size profiling
  - [GitHub Link](https://github.com/rustwasm/twiggy)
- Chrome DevTools for WebAssembly
  - [Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/reference#wasm)

### 4. For Resumability Concepts (as they relate to your focus areas)

**Start with:**

- **"Resumable vs. Hydration"** by Mi≈°ko Hevery (Qwik creator)
  - [Article Link](https://www.builder.io/blog/resumable-vs-hydration)
  - Explains the fundamental concepts clearly

**Then explore:**

- Leptos server functions and hydration implementation
  - [Documentation](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/server/index.html)

## Integrated Learning Plan (First 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Foundations Across All Areas

**Days 1-2: Signal Fundamentals**

- Read Ryan Carniato's fine-grained reactivity article
- Explore Leptos signal implementation
- Begin Chapter 1 of Blackheath's FRP book

**Days 3-4: DOM and WASM Foundations**

- Read "WebAssembly for Web Developers"
- Explore web-sys DOM API documentation
- Study Leptos view macro implementation

**Days 5-7: Profiling and Resumability Basics**

- Read Rust WASM profiling chapter
- Explore Chrome DevTools for WASM
- Read "Resumable vs. Hydration" article

### Week 2: Deeper Exploration

**Days 8-10: Signal Implementation**

- Continue Blackheath's FRP book (Chapters 2-3)
- Implement a simple signal system from scratch
- Study Leptos dependency tracking implementation

**Days 11-14: Integration Projects**

- Create a small project that combines all focus areas
- Implement a component with custom DOM manipulation
- Profile your implementation and optimize it
- Add resumability considerations to your design

## Conclusion

Rather than starting with just Blackheath's FRP book, this multi-faceted approach will give you a more balanced foundation across all your focus areas. The book remains valuable, but it works better as one component of a broader learning strategy that includes more directly applicable resources for Leptos, DOM manipulation, and WASM profiling.

This approach also allows you to see connections between your focus areas from the beginning, which will help you develop more integrated and innovative solutions as you progress.
