# Database Strategy

## Indexing Strategy

- Primary keys: B-tree indexes (default)
- Foreign keys: B-tree indexes
- Frequently queried fields:
  - `user_id` on all tables
  - `status` on Tasks and Goals
  - `due_date` on Tasks
  - `target_date` on Goals

## Migration Strategy

- Version controlled migrations
- Forward-only migrations
- Rollback support for recent migrations
- Data preservation during schema changes

## Backup Strategy

- Regular automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup verification process
- Retention policy:
  - Daily backups: 7 days
  - Weekly backups: 4 weeks
  - Monthly backups: 3 months

## Performance Optimization

- Regular VACUUM operations
- Index maintenance
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling

## Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints
- Unique constraints
- Not null constraints
