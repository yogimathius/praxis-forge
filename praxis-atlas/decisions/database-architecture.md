# Database Relationship Priority Rankings

1. Users to Tasks/Goals/Habits/ActivityLogs/AIRecommendations (Rank: 1)

   - Essential: Every item must be associated with a user.
   - Core functionality of the application.

2. Goals to Tasks (Rank: 2)

   - Important: Users often create tasks to achieve specific goals.
   - Allows tracking progress towards goals through completed tasks.
   - User flow: When creating a task, a user might want to associate it with a goal.

3. Habits to ActivityLogs (Rank: 2)

   - Important: Crucial for tracking habit streaks and progress.
   - User flow: When a user logs a habit completion, it should be recorded in ActivityLogs.

4. Tasks to ActivityLogs (Rank: 3)

   - Useful: Helps in tracking task completion and user engagement.
   - User flow: When a user completes a task, it could be automatically logged.

5. Goals to Habits (Rank: 3)

   - Useful: Some habits might contribute to long-term goals, but not all will.
   - User flow: When creating a habit, a user might optionally link it to a goal.

6. AIRecommendations to Tasks/Goals/Habits (Rank: 3)

   - Useful: Allows for more targeted recommendations.
   - User flow: AI might suggest new tasks, goals, or habits based on user behavior.

7. Goals to ActivityLogs (Rank: 4)

   - Optional: Useful for tracking goal progress, but could be inferred from associated task completions.
   - User flow: Goal progress updates could be logged, but might not need a direct relationship.

8. Tasks to Habits (Rank: 4)

   - Optional: Some recurring tasks might be habits, but many won't be.
   - User flow: Users might want to convert a recurring task into a habit.

9. AIRecommendations to ActivityLogs (Rank: 5)
   - Nice-to-have: Could be useful for tracking which recommendations were acted upon.
   - Not directly part of the user flow, more for backend analysis.

## Decision

Based on this analysis, we will implement relationships ranked 1-3 in our initial database schema. Relationships ranked 4-5 will be considered for future iterations if user testing and usage data indicate a need for them.

This approach allows us to create a focused, efficient database structure while leaving room for future enhancements based on actual user needs and behaviors.
