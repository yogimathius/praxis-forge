# AI-Powered Personal Life Assistant

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Task management with natural language input
- AI-driven personalized scheduling
- Goal tracking and habit formation tools
- Real-time updates and data synchronization
- (Stretch Goal) User activity analytics and insights

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance optimization for responsive user experience
- Data privacy and security
- Scalability to handle multiple users and growing data

## System Design

### Architecture Overview

- Frontend: Rust with WebAssembly (Yew Framework)
- Backend: Elixir/Phoenix Framework
- AI Integration: rust-bert for NLP tasks
- Desktop Packaging: Tauri

### Component Breakdown

1. User Interface (Rust/Yew)

   - Task input and management
   - Calendar and scheduling view
   - Goal and habit tracking interface
   - Settings and user profile

2. Backend Server (Elixir/Phoenix)

   - API endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Real-time communication handling
   - Data processing and storage management

3. AI Module (rust-bert)

   - Natural language processing for task input
   - Personalized recommendations engine
   - Text classification for task categorization

4. Desktop Application Wrapper (Tauri)
   - Native OS integration
   - Local storage management

## Database Design

### Data Models

1. User

   - ID, username, email, password_hash, preferences

2. Task

   - ID, user_id, title, description, due_date, status, category

3. Goal

   - ID, user_id, title, description, target_date, progress

4. Habit

   - ID, user_id, title, frequency, streak_count

5. AnalyticsData (for stretch goal)
   - ID, user_id, data_type, value, timestamp

### Database Choice

- PostgreSQL for robust relational data storage
- Consider Redis for caching and real-time features
