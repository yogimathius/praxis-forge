### **Considerations for Choosing Between Rust and Elixir**

- **Rust:**

  - **Pros:**

    - High performance and memory safety.
    - Strong type system and concurrency model.
    - Single language for both frontend (Yew) and backend.

  - **Cons:**

    - Steeper learning curve.
    - Smaller ecosystem for web development compared to other languages.

- **Elixir:**

  - **Pros:**

    - Built on the Erlang VM, offering excellent concurrency and fault tolerance.
    - Phoenix framework provides rapid development capabilities.
    - LiveView enables real-time, interactive UIs without JavaScript.

  - **Cons:**

    - Requires context switching between Rust and Elixir if both are used.
    - Integration with Rust (if needed) adds complexity.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Technology Decision:**

   - Evaluate the pros and cons.
   - Decide whether to use Rust, Elixir, or a combination based on project requirements and your learning goals.

2. **Update Project Plan:**

   - Adjust milestones and tasks to align with the chosen technologies.
   - Ensure that interfaces between components are well-defined.

3. **Design UI/UX:**

   - Develop detailed UI/UX designs considering the capabilities of the chosen frontend framework.

4. **Begin Development:**

   - Set up development environments accordingly.
   - Start with foundational components to establish a solid base.
